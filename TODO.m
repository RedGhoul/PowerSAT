    % can we view this as one massive array, and everything is a train ?
    % one N = 1 millisec ?
    % what exactly does the index mean ? or supposed to mean ?
    % is each index in freq Domain refer to a freq ?
    
    % Does this part need to be random or can it be exact ?
    % The duration of each digit is 50 milliseconds, 
    % with 50 milliseconds silence between subsequent
    % digits.
    
    % when you say that the amp has to be between 1 and 2, 
    % do you mean to say that each and every point has to 
    % hold to that rule, before noise? Multiple by the alpha
    % alpha sqaured is power 
    % do we have to go through each and every point ?
    
    %Fs and Ts ? - RUA
    
    % Delays
    
    % Do we need any varition in the delays ?
    % can the delay just be concatnating some zeros on both sides ?
    
    % Noise
    % noise = randn(1,signalSize) .* -1; % should this be postive noise ?
    % since when you sqaure it will be postive anyways ? Since your just
    % sqauring stuff
    % when you add noise it's amp does not have to be between 1 and 2 ?
